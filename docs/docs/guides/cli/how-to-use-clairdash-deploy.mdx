# Sync your changes with Clairdash deploy

## `clairdash deploy` syncs the changes in your dbt project to Clairdash

If you've made some changes to your dbt project and you'd like to make them available in your Clairdash project, you can easily do this using the `clairdash deploy` command in the Clairdash CLI tool.

```shell
git checkout main # checkout main or master - or whatever your production branch name is where you've merged your changes
git pull
clairdash deploy # --target prod. If you use developer profiles in your dbt project, you might need this flag. See below.
```

This will deploy the changes in your dbt project to the Clairdash project you set up on your CLI tool earlier.

:::info

**Note:** Clairdash's deploy command will deploy using your **default dbt profile** unless you specify to use a different target. For example, if you've set up a developer profile where it targets a dev dataset (like `dbt_khindson.my_model_names`), then you'll need to pass the production target in your `clairdash deploy` command. Something like: `clairdash deploy --profile prod`.

And voil√†! Once it's completed click the URL to head straight to your project where your changes will be ready to be explored.
