# Test your changes with Bigbytes compile

If you've connected Bigbytes to GitHub, you can setup a `github action` and get Bigbytes to compile your project and test your changes whenever you open a pull request.

Adding this Bigbytes compile action will compile your dbt project's .yml files and check to see if there are any errors that will break your Bigbytes project. For example, a metric that references a dimension that doesn't exist.

### Step 1: add the credentials to Github secrets

<GithubSecrets />

### Step 2: Create deploy.yml workflow in Github

Go to your repo, click on `Actions` menu.

If you don't have any GitHub actions, you'll just need to click on `Configure`

![Github actions page](./assets/github-actions.png)

If you have some GitHub actions in your repo already, click on `New workflow`, then select `setup a workflow yourself`.

Now copy [this file](https://github.com/bigbytes/cli-actions/blob/main/compile.yml) from our [cli-actions](https://github.com/bigbytes/cli-actions) repo.

:::info
If you only use a subset of your dbt models in Bigbytes, then you'll want to specify that subset in your file [here](https://github.com/bigbytes/cli-actions/blob/d91de777ed3668b537acd141b734eca75def4e52/compile.yml#L65). For example, to only compile models with the tag `bigbytes`, you would change this line to: `run: bigbytes compile --select tag:bigbytes --project-dir "$PROJECT_DIR" --profiles-dir . --profile prod || bigbytes compile --select tag:bigbytes --project-dir "$PROJECT_DIR" --profiles-dir .`
:::

Give it a nice name like `compile-bigbytes.yml`

And commit this to your repo by clicking on `Start commit`.

### You're done!

Everytime you open a new pull request on the repository that contains your Bigbytes project, `bigbytes compile` will run and check to see if any of the changes you made will break your Bigbytes instance.

You can see the log on the `Github actions` page
