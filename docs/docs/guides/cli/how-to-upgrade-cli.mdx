# Upgrading your Clairdash CLI

## Check compatability

Your Clairdash CLI version should match the version of Clairdash you see in the UI (scroll to the bottom of your screen, and you should see it there!). You can check the version of
your CLI by running:

```shell
clairdash --version
```

If you need to upgrade your version of the Clairdash cli, run the following in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g @clairdash/cli
clairdash --version
```
