# Upgrading your Bigbytes CLI

## Check compatability

Your Bigbytes CLI version should match the version of Bigbytes you see in the UI (scroll to the bottom of your screen, and you should see it there!). You can check the version of
your CLI by running:

```shell
bigbytes --version
```

If you need to upgrade your version of the Bigbytes cli, run the following in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g @bigbytes/cli
bigbytes --version
```
