# Self-Host Bigbytes

Bigbytes is MIT licensed and open source. You can self-host Bigbytes on your own infrastructure.

This guide is designed for DevOps Engineers that are familiar with Docker, Kubernetes, and are comfortable configuring environment variables, SMTP credentials, and database connections.
If you're unsure whether to self-host please read our guide on [Bigbytes Cloud vs. Self-Hosted](./bigbytes-cloud-vs-self-hosted.mdx).

## Prerequisites for self-hosting

- Access to a kubernetes cluster and [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)
- Docker

## Self-host Bigbytes on Kubernetes

The following steps will create a Bigbytes instance and a postgres database to store your metadata (note: this is
separate to your data warehouse with your analytics data).

We recommend using kubernetes + helm but you can alternatively follow these guides for a minimum deployment without
kubernetes:

- [Docker compose](./self-host-bigbytes-docker-compose.mdx)
- [Restack](./self-host-bigbytes-restack.mdx)

To deploy Bigbytes on your Kubernetes cluster you can use our community maintained Helm chart: https://github.com/bigbytes/helm-charts.
This will get you started with the simplest configuration possible. At the end of this guide you can find a list of configuration options to customise your Bigbytes instance and make it production ready.

### 1. Add the Bigbytes Helm repository

```bash
helm repo add bigbytes https://bigbytes.github.io/helm-charts
```

### 2. Create a namespace for Bigbytes

```bash
kubectl create namespace bigbytes
```

### 3. Create a minimum configuration for Bigbytes

At minimum you should configure:

- `secrets.BIGBYTES_SECRET` - this variable is used by Bigbytes to encrypt data at rest in the database. You must
  keep this secret. If this is lost, you will not be able to access your data in Bigbytes.
- `service.type` - by default the Bigbytes UI and API is exposed on a `ClusterIP` service. This means that it is
  only accessible from within the Kubernetes cluster. If you want to access Bigbytes from outside the cluster,
  you can change this to `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types) for more information.
- `SITE_URL` - if you know the URL that Bigbytes will be accessible at, you can set this variable. This will
  ensure that all links in Bigbytes are correct. If you don't know the URL yet, you can leave this blank and
  update it later.

Example `values.yaml` file containing our configuration:

```yaml
# values.yaml
secrets:
  BIGBYTES_SECRET: notverysecret

configMap:
  SITE_URL: https://bigbytes.mycompany.com

service:
  type: NodePort
```

### 4. Install Bigbytes with helm

Create a new helm release called `bigbytes` using the `getbigbytes/bigbytes` helm chart. In this example we're also
using the namespace `-n bigbytes`. Finally we apply our minimum configuration from above using `-f values.yaml`.

```bash
helm install bigbytes getbigbytes/bigbytes -n bigbytes -f values.yaml
```

### 4 (alternative). Install Bigbytes with kubectl

If you prefer not to manage your deployment with helm, you can generate the kubernetes manifests and apply them
using `kubectl`.

```bash
helm template bigbytes getbigbytes/bigbytes -n bigbytes -f values.yaml > bigbytes.yaml
kubectl apply -f bigbytes.yaml
```

Visit your `SITE_URL` to access Bigbytes!

## Configure Bigbytes for production

Now you have a working Bigbytes instance, you can customise it to your needs. The following docs cover the most
common configuration options, including those we recommend before going to production:

**Recommended for production usage**

- [Secure Bigbytes with HTTPS](./customize-deployment/secure-bigbytes-with-https.mdx)
- [Configure Bigbytes to use an external database](./customize-deployment/configure-bigbytes-to-use-an-external-database.mdx)
- [Configure SMTP for email notifications](./customize-deployment/configure-smtp-for-bigbytes-email-notifications.mdx)
- [Configure Bigbytes to use external object storage](./customize-deployment/configure-bigbytes-to-use-external-object-storage.mdx)
- [Resource recommendations](./customize-deployment/recommended-resources.mdx)

**Optional configuration**

- [Use SSO login for self-hosted Bigbytes](./customize-deployment/use-sso-login-for-self-hosted-bigbytes.mdx)
- [Enable scheduler in self-hosted Bigbytes](./customize-deployment/enable-scheduler-in-self-hosted-bigbytes.mdx)
- [Configure a Slack App for Bigbytes](./customize-deployment/configure-a-slack-app-for-bigbytes.mdx)
- [Configure environment variables for Bigbytes](./customize-deployment/environment-variables.mdx)
- [Enable headless browser for Bigbytes](./customize-deployment/enable-headless-browser-for-bigbytes.mdx)
- [Configure Logging for Bigbytes](./customize-deployment/configure-logging-for-bigbytes.mdx)
