# Self-Host Clairdash

Clairdash is MIT licensed and open source. You can self-host Clairdash on your own infrastructure.

This guide is designed for DevOps Engineers that are familiar with Docker, Kubernetes, and are comfortable configuring environment variables, SMTP credentials, and database connections.
If you're unsure whether to self-host please read our guide on [Clairdash Cloud vs. Self-Hosted](./clairdash-cloud-vs-self-hosted.mdx).

## Prerequisites for self-hosting

- Access to a kubernetes cluster and [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) installed
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/)
- Docker

## Self-host Clairdash on Kubernetes

The following steps will create a Clairdash instance and a postgres database to store your metadata (note: this is
separate to your data warehouse with your analytics data).

We recommend using kubernetes + helm but you can alternatively follow these guides for a minimum deployment without
kubernetes:

- [Docker compose](./self-host-clairdash-docker-compose.mdx)
- [Restack](./self-host-clairdash-restack.mdx)

To deploy Clairdash on your Kubernetes cluster you can use our community maintained Helm chart: https://github.com/clairdash/helm-charts.
This will get you started with the simplest configuration possible. At the end of this guide you can find a list of configuration options to customise your Clairdash instance and make it production ready.

### 1. Add the Clairdash Helm repository

```bash
helm repo add clairdash https://clairdash.github.io/helm-charts
```

### 2. Create a namespace for Clairdash

```bash
kubectl create namespace clairdash
```

### 3. Create a minimum configuration for Clairdash

At minimum you should configure:

- `secrets.CLAIRDASH_SECRET` - this variable is used by Clairdash to encrypt data at rest in the database. You must
  keep this secret. If this is lost, you will not be able to access your data in Clairdash.
- `service.type` - by default the Clairdash UI and API is exposed on a `ClusterIP` service. This means that it is
  only accessible from within the Kubernetes cluster. If you want to access Clairdash from outside the cluster,
  you can change this to `LoadBalancer` or `NodePort`. See the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types) for more information.
- `SITE_URL` - if you know the URL that Clairdash will be accessible at, you can set this variable. This will
  ensure that all links in Clairdash are correct. If you don't know the URL yet, you can leave this blank and
  update it later.

Example `values.yaml` file containing our configuration:

```yaml
# values.yaml
secrets:
  CLAIRDASH_SECRET: notverysecret

configMap:
  SITE_URL: https://clairdash.mycompany.com

service:
  type: NodePort
```

### 4. Install Clairdash with helm

Create a new helm release called `clairdash` using the `clairview/clairdash` helm chart. In this example we're also
using the namespace `-n clairdash`. Finally we apply our minimum configuration from above using `-f values.yaml`.

```bash
helm install clairdash clairview/clairdash -n clairdash -f values.yaml
```

### 4 (alternative). Install Clairdash with kubectl

If you prefer not to manage your deployment with helm, you can generate the kubernetes manifests and apply them
using `kubectl`.

```bash
helm template clairdash clairview/clairdash -n clairdash -f values.yaml > clairdash.yaml
kubectl apply -f clairdash.yaml
```

Visit your `SITE_URL` to access Clairdash!

## Configure Clairdash for production

Now you have a working Clairdash instance, you can customise it to your needs. The following docs cover the most
common configuration options, including those we recommend before going to production:

**Recommended for production usage**

- [Secure Clairdash with HTTPS](./customize-deployment/secure-clairdash-with-https.mdx)
- [Configure Clairdash to use an external database](./customize-deployment/configure-clairdash-to-use-an-external-database.mdx)
- [Configure SMTP for email notifications](./customize-deployment/configure-smtp-for-clairdash-email-notifications.mdx)
- [Configure Clairdash to use external object storage](./customize-deployment/configure-clairdash-to-use-external-object-storage.mdx)
- [Resource recommendations](./customize-deployment/recommended-resources.mdx)

**Optional configuration**

- [Use SSO login for self-hosted Clairdash](./customize-deployment/use-sso-login-for-self-hosted-clairdash.mdx)
- [Enable scheduler in self-hosted Clairdash](./customize-deployment/enable-scheduler-in-self-hosted-clairdash.mdx)
- [Configure a Slack App for Clairdash](./customize-deployment/configure-a-slack-app-for-clairdash.mdx)
- [Configure environment variables for Clairdash](./customize-deployment/environment-variables.mdx)
- [Enable headless browser for Clairdash](./customize-deployment/enable-headless-browser-for-clairdash.mdx)
- [Configure Logging for Clairdash](./customize-deployment/configure-logging-for-clairdash.mdx)
