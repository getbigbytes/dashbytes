# Secure Bigbytes with HTTPS

To run Bigbytes in production it is highly recommended to secure it with HTTPS. This is usually done using your
cloud provider's load balancer or ingress controller. Optionally you could use a proxy service like [nginx]
(https://www.nginx.com/) or [traefik](https://traefik.io/).

## Configuration options for HTTPS

```yaml
# values.yaml
configMap:
  # Ensures all Bigbytes links use https
  SITE_URL: https://bigbytes.mycompany.com

  # Only allow cookies to be sent over HTTPS
  SECURE_COOKIES: 'true'

  # (optional) allow http traffic behind a https enabled proxy
  TRUST_PROXY: 'true'

# Depending on your ingress implemantation you may need to set the following
service:
  type: NodePort

# Example ingress controller configuration
ingress:
  enabled: true
  annotations: {}
  hosts:
    - host: bigbytes.mycompany.com
      paths:
        - path: /*
          pathType: ImplementationSpecific
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - bigbytes.mycompany.com
      secretName: bigbytes-tls
```
